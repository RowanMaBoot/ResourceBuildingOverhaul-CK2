EVTTITLE_TSK.1;Infrastructure & Roads;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TSK.1;TSK features a custom building system, built around an upgradeable provincial infrastructure & roads. From the beginning of the game infrastructure is handed out to provinces - based on the region the province is based in, the year, and further influenced by the rank of the holder. So in most cases, you'll encounter a blocker when upgrading buildings - infrastructure. Infrastructure can be upgraded by right clicking on the capital holding in a province, with up to five levels possible. Do be warned that infrastructure has upkeep, and it isn't a great idea to upgrade it all at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
